                <strong>Explanation:</strong> A <strong style="color: red;">Malignant</strong> tumor means that the cells are cancerous. 
                These cells can grow and spread to other parts of the body. It is important to consult your healthcare provider for further 
                testing and treatment options. Early detection and action are crucial for managing malignancy.

                <strong>Explanation:</strong> A <strong style="color: green;">Benign</strong> tumor means that the cells are non-cancerous. 
                Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body and are generally not life-threatening. However, regular checkups 
                and monitoring are still recommended to ensure the tumor does not develop into something more serious.
